# 🪙 Voice Coin Toss Referee (Biased)

A realistic **voice-controlled online coin toss referee** designed for sports toss scenarios — with a subtle statistical advantage built in.

The app listens to voice commands like:
- “Flip the coin”
- “Heads” / “Tails”

The result is announced using a **referee voice**, just like on the field.

## 🎯 Key Concept

- Captain B gives voice commands
- The system waits for the call
- Coin is tossed only after “Heads” or “Tails”
- Outcome is biased **9:1 in favour of Captain A**
- Still looks fair and realistic
